# Technical Specifications - Kirebos Networks

## System Architecture
Kirebos Networks is designed with a modular architecture to effectively manage security, network connections, and event logging. The system architecture includes several key modules:

- **Security Module**: Manages authentication, authorization, and data encryption to protect against unauthorized access.
- **Network Module**: Responsible for managing network connections, including DMZ settings, providing control and real-time monitoring.
- **Logging Module**: Records important events, errors, and user actions to facilitate maintenance and troubleshooting.

## Dependencies
The Kirebos Networks project relies on several libraries and tools for optimal functionality:

- **Python 3.x**: Used for configuration management scripts and DMZ control.
- **OpenSSL**: For data encryption, ensuring the confidentiality of sensitive information.
- **UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall)**: Firewall management tool for Linux.
- **Qt**: Used for the graphical interface in the Desktop version.
- **YAML**: Configuration file format for easy reading and writing of settings.

## System Requirements
To ensure optimal performance, Kirebos Networks requires the following system specifications:

- **Operating System**: Linux, Windows, or macOS
- **RAM**: Minimum 2 GB
- **Disk Space**: Minimum 500 MB for installation and log files
- **Network Connection**: Required for monitoring and DMZ management features

## Key Components
### 1. Security
The security module includes:
- **Authentication**: User access control via a secure login system.
- **Encryption**: AES-256 algorithm used for encrypting sensitive data.
- **Firewall**: Configuring firewall rules to allow or block connections based on defined settings.

### 2. Network Connections
The network module includes:
- **DMZ Management**: Configured demilitarized zone to filter unauthorized connections.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Monitoring of network connections to detect any suspicious activity.

### 3. Logging
The logging module includes:
- **Log Recording**: Creating log files for each important event.
- **Log Retention**: Storing logs for a configurable duration, allowing historical review of events.
