## Configuration Files

- **config.yaml**: The master configuration file that centralizes key settings for the production environment. It references specific configuration files to streamline management.
- **app_config.yaml**: Defines primary application settings, including name, version, and maintenance mode.

- **api_config.yaml**: Defines API settings such as rate limiting, timeouts, and token expiration policies.

## Usage

Each configuration file should be reviewed and tailored to the specific requirements of the production environment prior to deployment.

### Security

It is vital to secure configuration files containing sensitive information, such as passwords and encryption keys. Access to this directory should be restricted to system administrators only.
